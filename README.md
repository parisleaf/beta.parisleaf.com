[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/parisleaf/parisleaf.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/parisleaf/parisleaf.com)

A frontend blog-style app that fetches data using the WP REST API.

## Git Conventions

**1 Topic = 1 Commit.** Each commit should be attributed to one change.

**Never commit half-done work.** Commits are made to wrap up something completed, no matter how small the change.

#### Branches
There are two long-term branches - **master** and **develop** - that should never be removed. New branches should be merged into **develop** when complete. Once tested and confirmed to be stable, the **develop** branch should be merged into **master** with an updated [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) tag.

Use NPM to bump the version and automatically stage a commit with the new version tag.
```shell
npm version [major|minor|patch]
```

**Master** contains *production-ready* code only, and is accessed at [parisleaf.com](https://parisleaf.com)

**Develop** contains *potentially unstable* code, and is accessed at [staging.parisleaf.com](https://staging.parisleaf.com).

These two branches of the frontend are hosted on the same Droplet in Digital Ocean, and deployed via [dokku-alt](https://github.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt).

## Architecture

#### Server
Node.js v0.11 (harmony flag enabled)

#### Middleware
[koa.js](https://github.com/koajs/koa)

#### Client
[React.js](https://github.com/facebook/react) is rendered server-side and then resumed on the client.

Content is fetched from a REST API endpoint. [WP-API](http://wp-api.org/) generates the JSON data for this endpoint on top of a standard WordPress installation. That project can be found at [parisleaf/wp.parisleaf.com](https://github.com/parisleaf/wp.parisleaf.com).

## Tooling

#### browserify (CommonJS)

JavaScript is organized into CommonJS modules and bundled with [browserify](http://browserify.org/) for the browser.

#### react-router

Routing is handled with react-router. Combined with Browserify and server-side rendering, this enables us to write isomorphic JavaScript. Learn more about [isomorphic JavaScript applications](http://isomorphic.net/).

#### 6to5

JavaScript files in `src` are compiled with 6to5. This lets us use ES6 features like arrow functions and class syntax in today's JavaScript environments. 6to5 also handles React JSX transformation.

#### libsass

Stylesheets are compiled using the [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc) implementation of [libsass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass).

The Dockerfile takes care of installing sassc. You'll probably want to install it on your own machine, too. On OS X: `brew install sassc`

On Linux, it's [a bit more complicated](http://crocodillon.com/blog/how-to-install-sassc-and-libsass-on-ubuntu).

## Development

1. Clone the repository to your development environment.
  ```git
  git clone git@github.com:parisleaf/parisleaf.com.git
  ```

2. Duplicate .env.example and rename it to .env. Open the file and set your environment variables.

3. Build the application.
  ```shell
  make build
  ```
  Running `make` again will cause only files with updated dependencies to rebuild.

4. Spin up the local dev server.
  ```shell
  make watch
  ```
  This will watch for changes, rebuild, and inject changes in the browser as files are changed.

If it's the first build, you can run `make fast-build`. This will build the application more quickly, but it won't check for changes â€” it runs every time. On subsequent builds, use `make build`.

## Deployment

In both staging and production, this app is set up to deploy via dokku-alt. Pushing to dokku-alt will automatically build a new container based on whatever git commit you just pushed.

#### Production

In production, the `master` branch is deployed to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org). Travis will then deploy to dokku-alt if all tests pass:

1. `git push`
2. Check [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org)

#### Staging

In staging, the `develop` branch is deployed directly to dokku-alt:

1. `git remote add dokku-staging dokku@parisleaf.com:staging`
2. `git push dokku-staging develop:master`

Refer to [dokku-alt's documentation](https://github.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt) for more information.
